# Jupyter_firefox_container

HELLO CONNECTION 
I am back with some new surprising item i.e DOCKER IMAGES with code you can refer that code and learn and create you own repo on hub.docker .com 

Image contains: ( firefox, ifconfig, centos, jupyter, python3 ). I hope you will enjoy this images with code 

You can pull the image : docker pull vishu03/jupyter-firefox:latest 
                                
NOTE: when you use this image to run then --enc="DISPLAY" --net=host variable then only this images works 

docker run -it --env="DISPLAY" --net=host --name os1  vishu03/jupyter-firefox:latest
